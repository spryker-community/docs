# Guidelines for organizing a Spryker User Group

You want to organize Spryker meetups? Cool! Thank you so much for putting in the time and effort to organize these local meetups and bringing the community together on regular basis. **You are awesome!**

We already have a general [Code of conduct](https://commerceverse.space/discussion/27749/community-guidelines-code-of-conduct) for our community. This document is an addition to that specifically for organizers of the User Groups.

To align ourselves, have a consistent image and make sure your meetup gets the attention it deserves, we do have some tips & guidelines for you. If you have any questions/remarks about these, please let us know or submit a change!

## How to start:
- Let the Spryker Community team know so they can help you promote it. We will also add you to our [CommerceVerse](https://commerceverse.space/) discussion group for User Group organizers.

## What do we expect from you as an organizer:
### General organization
- Organize regular meetups. Once every 6 months is a good pace to start with.
- The meetups should be open to anyone that wants to join.
- Coordinate dates with surrounding User Group organizers.
- If you are organizing this as a commercial company, some promotion in exchange for your effort is ok. But the meetup should still be open to visitors and speakers from your competitors. This is encouraged in order to promote the local community cohesion and collaboration.
- Local organizers are the first point of contact for speakers and attendees, not Spryker or the Spryker community team.

### Content/ Topics
- Spryker is not in the lead of the ideas, topics or the program of a local User Group. It is all done by you as an organizer. However, we are happy to help out where needed.
- Coordinate speakers and topics with surrounding organizers.
- Topics can of course be shared between organizers if agreed upon the creator and the speaker. If the speaker can't or won't travel to other User Group meetings, please coordinate with them if you can copy their presentation and under which conditions. Always be respectful to the original creator.

### Announcing the event 
- Add your event to the CommerceVerse events overview. If you don't have the rights, please contact community@spryker.com.
- In your text, be as clear as possible about your target audience to manage expectations. For example: You don't want merchants showing up unknowingly to very technical developer sessions.

### During the event
- Say thanks to the location hosts and sponsors (when applicable).
- We would like you to setup a pull-up banner from Spryker. Request one in time and we will deliver them to you :).
- Try to get people to already submit ideas for new meetups (locations and topics).

### After the event
- Use CommerceVerse to thank all the participants and ask them to contribute new topics/locations for new meetings
- We highly recommend creating a blog (text or video) summary of the event and publish that on CommerceVerse for further promotion. These articles can of course contain links to or images from the location hosts and/or sponsors of the event.

## When following these guidelines, you can expect the following from the Spryker Community team:
- Promotion of your User Groups through our website and social channels.
- Access to our network of the best speakers from other events.
- We'll send over someone from Spryker to join the event
- We'll send you some Spryker merch to hand out to the participants of the event.
