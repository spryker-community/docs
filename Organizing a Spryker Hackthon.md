Awesome that you are considering organizing a Spryker Developer Hackathon!

# A Comprehensive Guide on Organizing a Spryker Developer Hackathon

## Goals

The goal of your hackathon is to have Spryker developers form project groups and deliver working code or a proof-of-concept at the end. As an additional benefit, the developers also get to socialize, meet other developers, and learn new things.

## Theme

A theme is optional, but can help set the tone and attract a specific audience to your event. Given that your hackathon is for Spryker developers, ensure the theme or challenge you select (if any) is relevant and interesting to them. It should inspire and motivate participants, and result in creative and innovative projects. You have the freedom to choose any theme, as long as it is engaging for Spryker developers.

## Logistics

Considering you are planning to host a physical event, selecting an appropriate venue is crucial. Ensure the venue is spacious enough to accommodate all participants, with reliable internet connection and enough power sources for all devices.

For a hackathon that lasts for 1-3 days, consider the needs of participants over that period. Make arrangements for food and beverages. 

## Budget
What you need obviously very much depends on what you need to spend. Mainly venue, catering and addition things that make the event more fun. To give you an indication: Previous events had an operating budget of about 200 euros per participant per day. You can ask participants to cover (part) of this, do it on company budget, or get sponsors to cover this.

## Date and Duration

Choose dates that would be convenient for most participants. Consider avoiding major holidays or events that may clash with your hackathon. The duration could be 1 to 3 days, depending on the depth of the projects and available resources. Previously it worked well to have part of the Hackathon take place in the weekend.

## Assemble your Team

Though Spryker can help with promotion and provide 2-5 developers to participate and assist on-site, the bulk of the organizational tasks will fall on you. You'll need someone to handle various aspects like logistics, catering, venue setup, and invitation management.

## Hackathon Structure

Design the flow of the hackathon, including registration, team formation, kick-off, hacking time, break times, presentations, and awarding. Make sure to include time for socialization and networking.

## Announcing the Hackathon

Create an attractive and informative invitation detailing the objective, theme, date, venue, and registration process of the hackathon. Spryker can help promote the event to reach a broader community of developers. 

## Rules and Judging Criteria

Establish clear rules for the hackathon, including code of conduct, project submission guidelines, and the judging process. While the judging criteria is up to you, ensure it aligns with the hackathon's goals and theme.

## Decide on Prizes (optional)

Decide on the prizes for the hackathon winners. While the specifics are up to you, remember that prizes should be enticing enough to motivate participants. Spryker can contribute by providing merchandise for winners (or all participants).

## Conduct the Hackathon

Ensure the event runs smoothly. Your onsite team should handle any logistical issues while the hackathon is ongoing. Ensure participants have everything they need, and keep them updated on timelines and any changes.

For collaboration and collection of the projects code, each team can create a new repository on [github.com/spryker-community](https://github.com/spryker-community). This makes sure that we have a centralized place for community projects and that we also provide continuity across multiple hackathons where people can build upon previous projects.

## Post-Hackathon Follow-up

After the hackathon, consider hosting a wrap-up meeting to discuss what worked well and areas for improvement. Share the results and achievements from the hackathon with participants, and thank everyone for their participation.

# Some additional tips & tricks:
* For the wifi: make sure port 22 is open for SSH traffic so developers can push/pull from GitHub (ask us how we know...ðŸ˜±).
* Make sure to have a working coffee machine or a backup.
* Have name badges/stickers, at least for day 1
* The shorter the Hackathon, the more important it is to organize the topics and teams beforehand. You could use Miro to facilitate this and maybe even invite everyone for a online kickoff meeting in the weeks before the event to handle this. If the hackathon itself is only 1 day, you don't want to "waste" 2 hours on this part.

By following these steps, you should be able to plan and execute a successful Spryker Developer Hackathon. Happy planning!
