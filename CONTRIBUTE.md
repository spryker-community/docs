The general [Spryker Community Guidelines // Code of Conduct](https://commercequest.space/coc) also apply here in our GitHub.

The items below are an extension to those guidelines, applying specifically to contributing code to our Spryker Community GitHub repositories.

_Please note that at the current moment, we're still in the process of creating a process around community contributions, so bare with us while we are working on this :)._

## Spryker Community code contribution guidelines
* **Open Source Code**: We encourage you to publish your code under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/), making it freely available for anyone to use or modify.
* **Ownership and Permissions**: When contributing code, please ensure it's either your original work or you have explicit permission to share it. Do not include code from clients or employers without proper authorization.

If you want to start a new project on github.com/spryker-community and thus need your own repo: please DM Florian Schwarzmeier or send an e-mail to community@spryker.com.
