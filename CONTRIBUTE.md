The general [Spryker Community Guidelines // Code of Conduct](https://commerceverse.space/discussion/27749/community-guidelines-code-of-conduct) also apply here in our GitHub.

The items below are an extension to those guidelines, applying specifically to contributing code to our Spryker Community GitHub repositories.

_Please note that at the current moment, we're still in the process of creating a process around community contributions, so bare with us while we are working on this :)._

## Spryker Community code contribution guidelines
* Code published here should be open source: free for everyone else to use as they see fit. Specifically, we promote publishing everything under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).
* To be clear about this: This means that when you're contributing code, you should NOT add any code (e.g. from clients or your employer) that you haven't either created yourself and/or don't have explicit permission to share in this manner.
