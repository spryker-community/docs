The general [Spryker Community Guidelines // Code of Conduct](https://commerceverse.space/discussion/27749/community-guidelines-code-of-conduct) also apply here in our GitHub.

The items below are an extension to those guidelines, applying specifically to contributing code to our Spryker Community GitHub repositories.

_Please note that at the current moment, we're still in the process of creating a process around community contributions, so bare with us while we are working on this :)._

## Spryker Community code contribution guidelines
* **Open Source Code**: We encourage you to publish your code under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/), making it freely available for anyone to use or modify.
* **Ownership and Permissions**: When contributing code, please ensure it's either your original work or you have explicit permission to share it. Do not include code from clients or employers without proper authorization.
